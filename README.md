# Elevator_Controller
To implement the elevator controller, we used Verilog as HDL. The focus of our project was the implementation and verification of a controller for a basic elevator functionality. We also proposed a methodology that utilizes the SCAN algorithm to enhance the efficiency and reliability of the controller.
