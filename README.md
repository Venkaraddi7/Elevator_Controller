# Implementation of Elevator Controller Using Verilog
To implement the elevator controller, we used Verilog as HDL. The focus of our project was the implementation and verification of a controller for a basic elevator functionality. We also proposed a methodology that utilizes the SCAN algorithm to enhance the efficiency and reliability of the controller. 
To accomplish this, we designed the controller using ModelSim tool for simulation and Precession Synthesis Tool for synthesizing the Design and target technology is Sparton6 device is XC6SLX4.
